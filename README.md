# Cars-Dashboard
Hello there, 
I created a data engineering project in order to research, plan, and program
a live & updated report with real data.
I want to deal with an API's that contains a lot of data for the challenge 💪
This project analyzes the national transportation in Israel 🚗
Along the way I learned:
- To fetch lots of data in chunks(batch process) with an API 
- Connect Python to MySql
- Host mysql server with a cloud provider
- Design & Create a full ETL piplines
- Designing tables that will accumulate the data and presenting it to the user
- Create dynamic filter with adjust queries
- Deploy Docker & Airflow for tasks monitoring and workflow management
- And much more...
This app contains 4 pages in the sidebar:
1. Home - the main page with the analytics dashboard.
2. Car Profile - report maker for cars in Israel by input only the license plate number, You are welcome to try it out!😊
3. About - information about the Tech stack & tools, architecture and the development process.
4. Contact - Ways to contact me (❁´◡`❁)

For your convenience, I pushed the project to a live server ("Streamlit" - PaaS) 
so you can easily access the website from here👍:
