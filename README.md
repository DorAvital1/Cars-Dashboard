# Cars-Dashboard
Hello there, 
I created a data engineering project in order to research, plan, and program
a live & updated report with real data and deal with an API's that contains a lot of data for the challenge ðŸ’ª
This project analyzes the national transportation in Israel ðŸš—
This project taught how:
- To fetch lots of data in chunks(batch process) with an API 
- Connect Python to MySql
- Design & Create a full ETL piplines
- Host mysql server live
- Designing tables that will accumulate the data and presenting it to the user
- Create dynamic filter with adjust queries and much more...
You can find more information about the architecture and the development process on the "about" page inside the website

For your convenience, I pushed the project to a live server ("Streamlit" - PaaS) so you can easily access the website from here:
